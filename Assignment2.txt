1.What is `NPM`?
   
        -NPM doesn't stands for specific abbreviation, It is the package manager which managaes all our packages 
        that our project needs, The other package manager is Yarn.

2.What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?

        -Parcel/Webpack/Vite are the bundlers which provide some super powers which makes our application 
        more performant and faster. Basically these are the Library which has JS files which provides some
        functioanlity to our application.Webpack is the bundlers which imported in create-react-app internally.

3.What is `.parcel-cache`?

        -Parcel-cache is the foldercontaines multiple files which is generated during our first build.
        Basically it stores the build files at the initial build and then use the same files for the subsequnt build
        which takes lesser time for the build than the previous build

4. What is `npx` ?

        -npx is the command used to execute the parcel basically NPM run=npx.

5.What is difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies?

        -dependencies =>Basically our application is dependent on some Lib which is known as dependencies, ex-React.
        -devDependencies =>basically some lib or module which is needed only in development env not in production env 
          which is known as devDependencies ex-Parcel.

6.- What is Tree Shaking?

         -Parcel or any bundlers provide tree shaking functioanality, which means it will remove the unwanted
         or deadcode from our application.
         How can I know that my code contains unwanted code?
             -If we use any Lib which containes 10 helper functions, out of which our project needed only 2 helper functions
             the rest 8 are the dead code, the parcel is too smart to remove the unwanter or dead code from our application.

7.What is Hot Module Replacement?

         -HMR is the functioanlity which parcel provide us, whennever we update any files in the applicaton.
         the HMR behind the scene uses File watcher alogorithm which is coded on C++, which in parallel watch our files
         for any changes and update the server without any refresh.


8.List down your favourite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your
own words?

        -Minifying => It minifies the files that can be used in production, which makes our application more performant

        -Manages dev and production build => It manages both dev and production build in the dits folder.
          basically the minified files

        -caching while development => Ot provides the caching while development, which stores our files and will provide
        less time build for the subsequent build.

        -Older version of Browsers => It supports the older version of browers, i.e provide browser List lib internally
        which makes our appliaction compatible for any type of browsers

        -Compression => It compress our files, It will rename the variable.


9.What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?

         -.gitignoresthe File used to ignore certain folder or files in the git.

         -parcel-cache, node modules, package-json, dist are the folder and the file Which we can put in .gitignore.

         -package-lock.json and all the files which we should not put in .gitignore.


10.What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json?

          -Package.json => It is the folder generated while initializing the npm, Basically it contains the
            configutaion about our application.

          -package-lock.json => It is the folder generated when we are installing any lib or modules, Basivally
          it locks the version of our lib so that it make sure the same version we are using in both dev and production env.

11.Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?

           -We should not modify anything in package-lock.json, the reason is it locks the exact version in dev.
             If we modify anything we probably gets error like my application works in dev and not in production.

           -So we not touch anything in package-lock.json

12.What is `node_modules` ? Is it a good idea to push that on git?

           -node_modules is the folder which contains all ourlib, Basically it is ike the database for
             our application.

           -It is not the good idea to put the node_modules in the git, Because it is the heaviest thing,
             which makes our application works very slow and less performant.

           -Anyway it will be regerated in server using package-lock.json

13.What is the `dist` folder?

           -It is the folder which contains both dev and production build.

           -We can put dist folder in .gitignore basically the one which is regenerated can be put in .gitignore.

14.What is `browserlists?

           -It is the internall lib which is imported along with Parcel, Basically it is used to make our application
           compatible to any version of browsers, probably the older version of browsers.
